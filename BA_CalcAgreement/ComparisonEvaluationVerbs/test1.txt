'

One of the major difficulties[ ]Trillian experienced in her relationship with Zaphod was learning to distinguish between him pretending to be stupid just to get people off their guard, pretending to be stupid because he could n't be bothered to think and wanted someone else to do it for him, pretending to be outrageously stupid to hide the fact that he actually did n't understand what was going on, and really being genuinely stupid.

But astoundingly, the fearsome invaders who, like most warlike races were only on the rampage because they could n't cope with things at home, were stunned by Versenwald 's extraordinary breakthroughs, joined in the celebrations and were instantly prevailed upon to sign a wide-ranging series of trading agreements and set up a programme of cultural exchanges.

disbelieved
Is it a sign of the approaching birth, or, even less than that, of the very first glow, low in the sky, of a day scarcely even heralded as yet, but in which we can already divine that thought - the thought that has been speaking for thousands of years without knowing what speaking is or even that it is speaking - is about to re-apprehend itself in its entirety, and to illumine itself once more in the lightning flash of being?

but the Christian religion didn ’ t last so long merely because everyone else believed it, because it was imposed by ruler and priesthood, because it was a means of social control, because it was the only story in town, and because if you didn ’ t believe it – or disbelieved it too vociferously – you might have a quickly truncated life.
