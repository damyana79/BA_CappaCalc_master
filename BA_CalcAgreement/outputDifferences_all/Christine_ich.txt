support
But why did the
            brave attempts by union leaders and concerned citizens to revive the steel industry ultimately fail? When
            examining the area’s history, culture, and economic situation we can identify four main reasons: the refusal
            of the international leadership of United Steelworkers of America to support their union’s Youngstown
            branch, the lagging international steel market, the lack of a clear, organized vision for individual
            initiatives such as the Save Our Valley Campaign, and crippling regionalism which caused animosity between
            different small towns in the region, all contributed in some way to the failure of the workers and union
            leaders to save the industry.
