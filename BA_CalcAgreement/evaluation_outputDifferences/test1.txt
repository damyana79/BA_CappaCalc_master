but the Christian religion didn ’ t last so long merely because everyone else believed it, because it was imposed by ruler and priesthood, because it was a means of social control, because it was the only story in town, and because if you didn ’ t believe it – or disbelieved it too vociferously – you might have a quickly truncated life.
