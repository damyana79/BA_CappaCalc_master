To Miss Kilman she was always very, very nice, but Miss Kilman squashed the flowers all in a bunch, and had n't any small talk, and what interested Miss Kilman bored her mother, and Miss Kilman and she were terrible together;

On the terrace, Madame Daville 's hyacinths were long since over, the white ones and the coloured ones, the double and the single ones, but now the edges of the beds were blooming with red pelargoniums and tiny violet Alpine flowers.

but the Christian religion didn ’ t last so long merely because everyone else believed it, because it was imposed by ruler and priesthood, because it was a means of social control, because it was the only story in town, and because if you didn ’ t believe it – or disbelieved it too vociferously – you might have a quickly truncated life.
