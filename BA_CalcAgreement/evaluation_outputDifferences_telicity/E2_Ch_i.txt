The Zirzla ships that remained, horribly beweaponed though they were, were now hopelessly outclassed by the devastating power of the Xaxisian ship, and were fleeing for cover behind the rapidly disintegrating moon, when the Xaxisian ship, in hurtling pursuit behind them, suddenly announced that it needed a holiday and left the field of battle.

misuse
That was the source of his dehumanization of history; as though, from age to age, history were drifting somewhere high above us in a kind of fatal superworld, as though it were taking its own course, which had nothing to do with us and was utterly impenetrable, as though history were a clever divinity that could only destroy us, cheat us, misuse us, or - at best - play jokes on us.

On the terrace, Madame Daville 's hyacinths were long since over, the white ones and the coloured ones, the double and the single ones, but now the edges of the beds were blooming with red pelargoniums and tiny violet Alpine flowers.

divine
Is it a sign of the approaching birth, or, even less than that, of the very first glow, low in the sky, of a day scarcely even heralded as yet, but in which we can already divine that thought - the thought that has been speaking for thousands of years without knowing what speaking is or even that it is speaking - is about to re-apprehend itself in its entirety, and to illumine itself once more in the lightning flash of being?

but the Christian religion didn ’ t last so long merely because everyone else believed it, because it was imposed by ruler and priesthood, because it was a means of social control, because it was the only story in town, and because if you didn ’ t believe it – or disbelieved it too vociferously – you might have a quickly truncated life.
